I'm really disappointed by this product and the top winder of the device quit after two months of Garinin does not respond to my emails for disassembled the device to determine what's wrong and possibly repair it It turns out the gears are cheap plastic and deteriorate this is the model I as long as I have I found that the winder DOES NOT increase the charge of a SEIKO probably because it runs too slow It does fine at keeping a mechanical automatic but it doesn't provide enough energy to a electric Kinetic even at the highest highly recommend looking at another
