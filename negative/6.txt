Started having problems with the watch At first the clasp was too hard to and then it wouldn't stay Every time I take the watch off it opens and slides and I have to readjust the the wiring in the mesh band has started to fray and often gets caught on my And two of the crystals around the face have fallen out and I haven't even had the watch more than months and do not wear
