I have been looking for a new dress watch for a am kind of a fussy I saw this watch and read the reviews It made me considered about buying I decided to buy this I've got it I thought of two words on my when I bought stuff or After I opened the I smiled all day Good few things want to mention you The watch is a little bit smaller than I expected it's not a promblem because my wrist it's so fits me be panic about the watch doesn't work at the first You have to let it charges for a you don't need to worry about changing love the lobster claw-clasp because I can adjust it always got a problem about paying extra for adjusting the recommend this watch to Buy for yourself or as a You will be happy
