First off let me say that the band isn't as dark in real life as it is in the picture that I saw on It's like a cotton candy And it stands a little tall on your wrist and can seem a little bulky if you're not used to a sports But it looks so It's a perfect hybrid of sport utility and This is my second G shock and my first one is still after so I know these watches last for a long My husband is jealous at how good this watch looks and wants a masculine one for Highly recommend this watch for looks and like everything about this
